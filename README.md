# lib_stl_embedded

A high-performance C++ STL-like library designed specifically for microprocessors and microcontrollers.

## Overview

This library provides efficient implementations of common STL containers and algorithms optimized for embedded systems with limited resources. The focus is on performance, minimal memory usage, and deterministic behavior.

## Features

- Memory-efficient container implementations (vector, list, map, etc.)
- No dynamic memory allocation (configurable static allocation)
- Optimized algorithms for embedded platforms
- Compatible with various microcontrollers and microprocessors
- Header-only implementation for easy integration

## Getting Started

See the documentation in the `docs` folder for usage examples and integration guides.

## License

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
